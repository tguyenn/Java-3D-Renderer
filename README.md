# Java Triangle Renderer

Made to learn about basics of computer graphics and practice Java. Referenced https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/construct-a-simple-3d-rendering-engine-with-java_599599

Takes a set of triangles and generates a simple 3D mesh with colors and shading using the Java Swing library. The resulting volume can be rotated by clicking and dragging with a mouse.

WIP: 
- Add support for free image rotation (no mouse)
- Add support for user selection of different shapes
- Add support to change colors
